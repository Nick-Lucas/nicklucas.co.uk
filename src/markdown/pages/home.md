#### I'm a full-stack software engineer and passionate problem solver

I've been building valuable business tools and experiences since 2014, making teams more efficient and effective, and working to create fantastic experiences for the customer. I love making customer's lives better, and working with teams to automate workloads so they can focus on what really matters.

What have I learned?

* **Use the right tool for the job:** Technologies should be assessed and chosen for the task at hand, and I've worked across a wide range of technologies and disciplines in the pursuit of this belief
* **Sensible and lean processes, with team buy-in:** Processes are there to help the team succeed, they should augment good communication, and the whole team should be free to iterate on them
* **Autonomy & trust:** People are smart, and given an understanding of their goals will find ways to reach them. Every engineer should be able to propose valuable work.
