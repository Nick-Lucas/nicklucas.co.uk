#### I'm a full-stack software engineer and problem solver

I've been building valuable business tools and experiences since 2014, making teams more efficient and effective. I love building great experiences for customers, and working with teams to automate workloads so they can focus on what really matters.

What have I learned?

* **Use the right tool for the job:** Technologies should be assessed and chosen for the task at hand, and I've worked across a wide range of technologies and disciplines in the pursuit of this belief, often now referring to myself as a Polyglot.
* **Sensible and lean processes with team buy-in:** Processes are there to help the team succeed, they should not try to replace good communication by handling every edge case
* **Autonomy & trust:** People are smart, and given an understanding of their goals they will help the organisation succeed. Sprint tasks aren't the only valuable work to be done.
