# Writing your own VS Code snippets to move faster

Snippets are great, blah blah blah, but until recently I thought creating my own must be a really convoluted process, and I should just live with the popular community snippets which don't perfectly meet my needs.

Wrong! Snippets are really easy to make, and very well documented.

```jsx
const a = 'b'
const a = 'b'
const a = 'b'
const a = 'b'
const a = 'b'

const MyFunc = () => {
  return <div>
    Hello world
  </div>
}
```
