# Welcome

It's been a few years since I've blogged or written articles, and the first time round it was for an [audio production](https://www.audio-times.com/category/nick-lucas/) blog, which I gave up around the time I moved on to training as a software engineer.

This is really just a quick note to say "I hope to put out some content", so I can be openly mocked if that doesn't happen. Also this is faster than implementing an empty blogs page, since it will never again be seen after the first entry, so _some_ content is needed here!
